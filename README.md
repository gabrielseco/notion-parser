# NotionParser

The notion parser script will ask you for a notion url.

If this notion url is found will filter all paragraphs that have an â†’ in its content.

Then will split the words in two properties swedish and english and we'll push the results to a database in the same page

## Requirements

You'll need an API_KEY from notion.

Check their [Getting Started Guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started) to get your credentials

## Installation

```sh
mix deps.get
```

## Run

```sh
source .env.dev && mix run lib/notion_parser.exs
```
